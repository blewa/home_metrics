h1. Home Metrics Utilities

Some utils I wrote to collect metrics from around the home.

h1. `portland_general_parser.py`

This script parses CSV files downloadable from the Portland General Electric usage portal and pushes them into a local InfluxDB instance.  Pushes data for cost as well as KW/h usage.
